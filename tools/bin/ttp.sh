# In order to be able to honor the 'logical machine' paradigm (which
# let the administrator have several execution nodes in the same machine),
# we have to manage the in-process command ". ttp.sh switch --node <name>".
# The run of this command depends of the FPATH variable having been
# previously set.
#
# When run in-process, the '$0' first argument is not the 'ttp.sh'
# command, but the running shell which is something like: '[-]<shell>'.
# Whether there is a leading dash ('-') or not indicates the presence
# of a login shell.
#
# If first character is '-',
#   - then we are in a login shell, which makes sure the command is
#     actually ". ttp.sh ..."
# else
#   - we are in a non-login shell, which does not say anything about
#     whether we have run ". ttp.sh .." or "ttp.sh ..."
#
# If running shell is Korn,
#   - this does not say anything about whether we have run
#     ". ttp.sh .." or "ttp.sh ..."
#   - FPATH will be honored, we so can call ttpf_main() as usual
# else
#   - we are in the user shell, which makes sure the command is actually
#     ". ttp.sh ..."
#   - we have to pre-load the function in a sub-environment.
#
# As a particular case, the ${0} argument is the full path of the current shell
# when the environment is initialized from a crontab.

#set -x
#echo "ttp.sh: 0=$0 #=$# *=$*" >&2

# The only allowed in-process invocation is the ". ttp.sh switch" command.
# Other in-process invocations may fall in error if FPATH is not honored
# (ksh being the only known shell to be able to autoload its functions,
#  typical sh-like shells, e.g. bash, would else fail)
